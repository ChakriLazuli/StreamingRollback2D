This project is to form the technical basis of a game with a streaming 2D world, supporting multiplayer via rollback net code. The net code is initially intended to run peer-to-peer without the need for a mediating server.

The target platform for hosting sessions is Windows, but joining sessions should be possible from web, for easy plug-and-play multiplayer.

Inspiration for the desire for these technical features is found in the multiplayer systems of From Software's Souls-adjacent library, and multiplayer mods for games such as AM2R or Hollow Knight.
